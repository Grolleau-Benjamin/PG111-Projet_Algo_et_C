# PG111 - Mise en place d'algorithme de compression

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to set up a list of compression algorithms using C language. The algorithms that will be implemented are:
- Move to Front (MTF)
- Huffman
- Lempel-Ziv (especially LZ78)

Note that the implementation of the last algorithm is not optimal and finished yet. But the two first are working very well.

## How to use
To use the program, a set of commands are available to make your life easier. Here is the list of commands available:
- `make` : Compile the program. After using this command, you can use the program with the command `./bin/main`
- `make clean` : Clean the program. This command will remove all the files generated by the compilation.
- `make test` : Run the tests. This command will run the tests available for all the algorithms implemented.
- `make doc` : Generate the documentation. This command will generate the documentation of the project in the folder `html/`. This documentation is generated using Doxygen.

But before doing anything, you need to run the script named `init_rep`, if you are on a Unix system run `./init_rep.sh`. But if you are on a Windows system, you need to run `.\init_rep.ps1`. This script will create the necessary folders for the project and add the lib path to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

## Authors
You can find the list of authors of the project in the file `AUTHORS`.

## License
We choose the Apache License 2.0 for this project. You can find the license in the file `LICENSE`. We have chosen this license because it offer a perfect balance between the freedom of the user and the protection of the authors. This license permit to set our code as open-source, encouraging the collaboration and the innovation. Users can use, modify and distribute the code as they want, but they need to mention the authors of the project. Ensuring that the authors are recognized for their work.

As we can observe, every algorithm has a specific folder tree. 
```bash
